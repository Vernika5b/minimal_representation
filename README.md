Convert variants at multi-allelic sites to their 'minimal representation', i.e. how they would be represented if they were the only allele present at the site.

This was forked from xBrowse and will eventually be integrated back in.

See explanation of this code and important use cases in [this CureFFI.org blog post](http://www.cureffi.org/2014/04/24/converting-genetic-variants-to-their-minimal-representation/).
